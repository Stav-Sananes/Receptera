## Accumulated Context

### Decisions (locked)

- Co-pilot first (no TTS, no telephony in v1)
- Hebrew-first (ivrit.ai + DictaLM 3.0 primary, Qwen 2.5 7B fallback)
- Apple Silicon M2+ as reference floor
- OSS self-host (Apache 2.0), Docker Compose one-liner
- STT: faster-whisper + ivrit-ai/whisper-large-v3-turbo-ct2 + Silero VAD
- LLM runtime: Ollama with Metal
- Embeddings: BGE-M3 via Ollama; Vector DB: ChromaDB
- Frontend: React + Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind (RTL)
- Parallelizable: Phases 2, 3, 4 after Phase 1

### Open Todos

- Execute Phase 1 research spike questions (see `research/STACK.md` §"Open questions")

### Blockers
